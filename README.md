A brief, one-paragraph description of what this application does and who it is for.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9.0 or higher)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v14 or higher)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash

cd my-awesome-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the required npm packages.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. You'll need to create a `.env` file.

1.  Make a copy of the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and update the values for your local environment (e.g., database connection details, API keys).

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables.

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 5. Run the Application

Finally, you can start the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
